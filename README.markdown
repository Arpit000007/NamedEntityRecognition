# Named Entity Recognition with Small Strongly Labeled and Large Weakly Labeled Data

We provide a three stage framework:

Stage I: Domain continual pre-training.
Stage II: Noise-aware weakly supervised pre-training.
Stage III: Fine-tuning. In this code base, we actually provide basic building blocks which allow arbitrary combination of different stages. We also provide examples scripts for reproducing our results in BioMedical NER.

NEEDLE demonstrates superior performance across multiple biomedical NER datasets, outperforming prominent models like BERT, BioBERT, and PubMedBERT. By effectively leveraging a combination of strongly and weakly labeled data with noise-aware strategies, it achieves state-of-the-art F1 scores: BC5CDR-chem: 91.38, BC5CDR-disease: 82.57, and NCBI-disease: 88.53, highlighting its ability to handle noisy labels while improving domain-specific entity recognitionâ€‹.
